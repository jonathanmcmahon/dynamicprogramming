# dynamicprogramming

### Dynamic programming problems and solutions explained ###

I am completing these exercises as a supplement to a graduate algorithms class at Georgia Tech.

Phase 2 of this project (after writing the Python code for all the exercises) is to go back through and create interactive Jupyter notebooks for each problem with some pretty Latex and the formal solution, with discussion.
